# grz-cli Container

A lightweight Docker container for [grz-cli](https://github.com/BfArM-MVH/grz-tools/blob/main/packages/grz-cli/README.md), a command-line tool for validating, encrypting, and uploading submissions to a genomDE Model Project GDC (Genome Data Center).

## Version

Current version: 1.5.1 (with `grz-check` 0.2.1)

### nextflow
